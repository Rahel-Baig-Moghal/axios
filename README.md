# Express App - Learning Journey

This is a simple Express application that demonstrates different types of authentication methods using Axios to make API requests to a mock API. This project is part of my journey in learning Node.js and Express.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the server using `npm start`.

## Usage

- Access different routes for different authentication methods:
  - `/noAuth`: No authentication required.
  - `/basicAuth`: Basic authentication using username and password.
  - `/apiKey`: Authentication using an API key.
  - `/bearerToken`: Authentication using a bearer token.

## Dependencies

- Express.js
- Axios

## Configuration

- Set your username and password in the `yourUsername` and `yourPassword` variables in `index.js`.
- Set your API key in the `yourAPIKey` variable in `index.js`.
- Set your bearer token in the `yourBearerToken` variable in `index.js`.

## Notes

- This is a basic example and not suitable for production use without proper security measures.
- Ensure that you do not commit sensitive information to version control.

## Learning Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with Express.js.
- Understand different authentication methods in web development.
- Learn how to make API requests using Axios.
- Practice building a simple server-side application.

## Learning Progress

I started this project to deepen my understanding of Node.js and Express. Throughout this project, I've learned how to handle different types of authentication, make API requests, and structure an Express application. I plan to continue building on this project by adding more features and enhancing security measures.
